 * EPI 16.3 Variant 5
 * Decimal number is a sequence of digits, i.e., a sequence over {0,1,2,..., 9}. The sequence has to be of length 1 or
 * more, and the first element in the sequence cannot be 0. Call a decimal number D monotone if D[i] <= D[i + 1], 0 <= i < |D|.
 * Write a program which takes as input a positive integer k and computes the number of decimal numbers of length k that are monotone.
